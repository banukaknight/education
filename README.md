<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://yudaganawa.000webhostapp.com)

Developped by:
* Banuka Vidusanka Paniyan Duwage
* Cheki Wangchuk
* Ihala Uswattage Kavindu Mohottala Gunawickrama
* Palakatiya Hewage Sanduni Ishara
* Samrin Kaur

During the past few months, much of the world has been heavily affected by the covid-19 pandemic. Everyone’s lifestyle has been disrupted and many organizations struggle to keep in business while ensuring public safety. So, the purpose of this project was to develop a product that can help the public stay safe while continuing regular operations.
The project is developing a website with distance learning capabilities for a local school in Sri Lanka named “Mo/Yudaganawa Vidyalaya, Buttala”. Schools have been closed for a long time and many parents are reluctant to send kids back to school due to the danger. So, this project provides a platform that can help students continue education from the safety of their homes while maintaining social distance and other guidelines by the government.
The website includes several modules aimed at aiding in academic and non-academic tasks. The timetable for scheduled classes will be provided for each student. Furthermore, the assignment module focuses on publishing and collecting assignments with timelines, and the marking process.
Additionally, a scrutiny portal was added to help students engage in the evaluation of assignments and tests. Automated marking of assignments can also be done.
Lecture content and all textbooks related to academics also accessible by the students so that students can easily prepare for their class tests, assignments and examinations. The system also features student attendance monitoring along with absent patterns and attendance targets.
Students are informed and given chance to participate in extracurricular activities and non-academic functions prepared by the school. All the announcements are providing on a daily basis so that students can update themselves by reading those announcements. A way to contact faculty through the website implemented.
The web site may include all the essential modules to make a good, functioning website that enables teachers and students to interact with each other and carry on their academic operations.
